**GPT-2 Powered Python Code Generator**
This project is an AI-driven application that generates fully functional Python code from natural language prompts using a fully fine-tuned GPT-2 model. It is designed to make coding more accessible for non-programmers and accelerate development workflows for experienced programmers.

**Overview**
The system leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to convert plain English instructions into executable Python code. By performing fully parameterized fine-tuning on GPT-2, the model has been adapted to produce accurate, readable, and scalable code for a wide range of use cases.

*Whether it's data analysis, automation, or algorithm design, this tool enables users to describe their requirements and receive complete Python solutions in response.*

**Features**
Natural Language to Code
Input a prompt or task description, and the system generates Python code automatically.

Fully Parameterized Fine-Tuning
GPT-2 is fine-tuned on domain-specific code datasets for improved accuracy and contextual understanding.

Code Explanation
Output includes inline comments and detailed explanations to aid learning and comprehension.

Customization Support
Users can modify and fine-tune the generated code to suit their specific needs.

Debugging and Optimization Suggestions
The system provides helpful recommendations for improving code performance and handling errors.

Use Cases
