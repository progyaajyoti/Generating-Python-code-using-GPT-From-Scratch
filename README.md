🧠 GPT-2 Powered Python Code Generator
An AI-driven application that generates fully functional Python code from natural language prompts using a fully fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This tool is designed to make coding more accessible for non-programmers while boosting productivity for developers through fast, intelligent code generation.

🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of large language models (LLMs) in automating Python code creation. By fine-tuning GPT-2 on carefully selected datasets, the model can generate clean, efficient, and scalable code based on simple user input. From data analysis scripts to algorithmic logic and automation workflows, the system supports a wide variety of use cases.

🎯 Features
✨ Natural Language to Code
Describe a task or functionality in plain English and receive complete Python code as output.

🛠️ Fully Parameterized Fine-Tuning
GPT-2 has been fine-tuned on domain-specific coding data for high accuracy and contextual understanding.

🧾 Code Explanation
Generated code includes inline comments and detailed explanations for better learning and usability.
